# Horse Racing Event Management System (C# Project)

## Overview

This project is designed to manage horse racing events, allowing racecourse managers to create and manage races, horse owners to enter their horses in races, and racegoers to view upcoming events. The system was developed in C# and offers flexibility in terms of data handling and user interaction through a simple GUI or menu-driven interface. 

The main functionalities include creating race events, adding races and horses, and viewing event details. The system supports reading data from files and demonstrates good object-oriented design, with a focus on abstraction, interface usage, and file handling.

## Features

### 1. Racecourse Manager:
- **Create a New Race Event**: Specify event name, location, and the number of races.
- **Add Races to Events**: Assign names and start times to races, with default names like "Race 1", "Race 2", etc.
- **Upload Horses for Each Race**: Load a list of horses for each race, where each horse has a name, date of birth, and a unique horse ID.

### 2. Horse Owner:
- **Enter a Horse in a Race**: Owners can enter their horses into available races.

### 3. Racegoer:
- **View Upcoming Events**: See a list of future racing events.
- **View Event Details**: Check race details, including horses entered in each race.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: C#
- **File Handling**: Handles data from text files to store and manage race data.
- **Data Structures**: Uses classes and objects, arrays, lists, and dictionaries to manage races and horses.
- **UI Options**: A console menu interface.
- **Collections and Enums**: Demonstrates the use of collections (lists, dictionaries) and enums.

## Project Structure

- **Classes and Interfaces**: Abstraction and interface-driven design to ensure scalability.
